# instagram-feed


## Description

This an Instagram feed implemented with an API Instagram provides. Unlike services like Facebook, Instagram does not provide it's own custom feed that one
can embed into their website. Frusturated by this I decided to build my own. Feel free to copy the code and use it on a website that you would find useful

## Setup

The feed defaults to Instagram's personal account. To switch the functionalities to an account of your choice, all you need to do is copy a link of the form:
https://www.instagram.com/<account name>/ and paste into line 11 of index.html, along with lines 10 and 24 in call.js. I hope that someone may find this useful for their own purposes.
